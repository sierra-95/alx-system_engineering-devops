One-server web infrastructure for www.foobar.com consists of a single server, running Nginx as the web server,
an application server to process dynamic content, and a MySQL database for data storage. 

1.	User wanting to access the website (www.foobar.com):
When a user wants to access the website, they will enter "www.foobar.com" in their web browser.

2.	Server: A server is a computer system that hosts the website and responds to user requests.
In this case, one server is responsible for handling all incoming requests.

3.	Domain Name:  The domain name "www.foobar.com" is the address used to identify and locate the website on the internet. 
It acts as a human-readable name for the server's IP address (e.g., 8.8.8.8).

4.	DNS Record: The "www" in www.foobar.com is a DNS (Domain Name System) record known as a subdomain.
It points to a specific resource on the server, which, in this case, is the website.

5.	Web Server (Nginx): The web server (Nginx) is responsible for processing and fulfilling incoming HTTP requests from users. 
It serves static content and forwards dynamic content requests to the application server.

6.	Application Server: The application server processes dynamic content and executes the server-side code
(e.g., PHP, Python, etc.). It interacts with the database to fetch or store data requested by users.

7.	Application Files: The application files are the code base of the website, written in a programming language like PHP or Python. 
These files reside on the server and contain the logic to generate dynamic content.

8.	Database (MySQL): The database stores and manages the website's data. It allows the application server to
store and retrieve information as required by the website.

9.	Communication with the User's Computer: The server uses the HTTP protocol to communicate with the user's computer.
When a user requests a web page, the server sends back the appropriate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, which the user's browser then renders as a webpage.

Issues with the Infrastructure:

1.	Single Point of Failure (SPOF): Since there is only one server, if it goes down or encounters issues,
the entire website will be inaccessible. There is no redundancy to handle incoming traffic if the server fails.

2.	Downtime during Maintenance: When performing maintenance, such as deploying new code or updating the web server,
the website may experience downtime, resulting in unavailability for users during that period.

3.	Scalability Limitations: With only one server, handling a significant increase in incoming traffic becomes challenging. 
The infrastructure lacks the ability to scale and accommodate high traffic volumes efficiently.

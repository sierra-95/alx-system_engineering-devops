A user wants to access my website hosted at www.foobar.com. To ensure high availability and handle increasing traffic,
I've designed a three-server web infrastructure. 
1.	Servers: The infrastructure includes three servers to distribute the load and improve performance.
2.	Web Server (Nginx): Nginx acts as the web server, handling incoming requests from users and serving static
content efficiently.
3.	Application Server: The application server handles dynamic content processing,
such as executing code and generating responses.
4.	Load Balancer (HAproxy): The load balancer, HAproxy,
is added to distribute incoming traffic across the three servers evenly.
It uses a round-robin distribution algorithm, sending requests to each server sequentially, 
ensuring a balanced load distribution.
5.	Application Files: The set of application files contains my code base,
which will be executed by the application server to generate dynamic content.
6.	Database (MySQL): A MySQL database is included to store and manage website data. 
It operates as a Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster.

Specifics:
1.	Load Balancer: The HAproxy is configured with a round-robin distribution algorithm to distribute incoming 
requests sequentially to each server.
2.	Load Balancer Setup: The setup enables an Active-Active configuration.
In this setup, all servers actively serve traffic,
sharing the load and ensuring high availability. If one server becomes unavailable, 
the other servers continue to handle the traffic.
3.	Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) Database Cluster: The database operates with one Primary node and two Replica nodes.
The Primary node is the master and handles write operations.
The Replica nodes are slaves and replicate data from the Primary node, handling read operations.
This setup ensures data redundancy and better-read performance.

Issues:
1.	Single Point of Failure (SPOF): The setup is still prone to SPOF as there is only one load balancer.
If the load balancer fails, the entire system may be affected.
2.	Security Issues: There are no firewalls or HTTPS configurations mentioned in this infrastructure,
potentially exposing it to security vulnerabilities.
3.	Monitoring: Lack of monitoring tools and practices could make it challenging to identify and address performance or
security issues proactively.
Three-server web infrastructure with a load balancer and database cluster provides better scalability and availability than a single-server setup.
